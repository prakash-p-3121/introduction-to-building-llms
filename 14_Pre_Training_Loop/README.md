</div>
<br>

This final section will bring everything together and explain the complete pre-training process. At a high level, the training loop is where the model actually learns from the vast dataset we prepared.

The core process involves:
1.  **Forward Pass:** Feeding a batch of text into the model to get its prediction for the next word.
2.  **Loss Calculation:** Comparing the model's prediction (logits) with the actual next word to calculate a "loss" value. The loss is a measure of how wrong the model was.
3.  **Backward Pass (Backpropagation):** Calculating the gradients for all the model's trainable weights ($W_q, W_k, W_v$, FFN weights, etc.) with respect to the loss.
4.  **Optimizer Step:** Using an optimizer (like Adam) to update all the weights slightly in the direction that will reduce the loss.

This loop is repeated billions or even trillions of times, and through this simple process of trial and error on a massive scale, the Large Language Model learns the intricate patterns of human language.
